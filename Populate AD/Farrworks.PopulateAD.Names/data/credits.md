# About

A repository of data that can be used when building random users/employees

# First/Last Name Credits

The below resources were used for first/last names data files

* census.gov
* ssa.gov
* www.quietaffiliate.com/free-first-name-and-last-name-databases-csv-and-sql
* extracts from various real A.D. sources

Lots of cleanup and merging was done to end up with a clean list of ~100K first names, and ~120K last names
